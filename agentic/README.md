# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

The `agentic/` directory is deprecated and preserved for reference only.

All AI agent configurations, prompts, rules, and workflows have moved to the [**.ai/**](file:///f:/Local_git/v0-frame/.ai/) directory.

## New Structure
- **Agents**: [.ai/agents/](file:///f:/Local_git/v0-frame/.ai/agents/)
- **Rules**: [.ai/rules/](file:///f:/Local_git/v0-frame/.ai/rules/)
- **Skills**: [.ai/skills/](file:///f:/Local_git/v0-frame/.ai/skills/)
- **Commands**: [.ai/commands/](file:///f:/Local_git/v0-frame/.ai/commands/)

Please refer to [.ai/README.md](file:///f:/Local_git/v0-frame/.ai/README.md) for more information.
